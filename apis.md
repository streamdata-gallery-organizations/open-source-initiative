description: The Open Source Initiative (OSI) is a California public benefit corporation,
  with 501(c)3 tax-exempt status, founded in 1998. We are also actively involved in
  Open Source community-building, education, and public advocacy to promote awareness
  and the importance of non-proprietary software. OSI Board members frequently travel
  the world to attend Open Source conferences and events, meet with open source developers
  and users, and to discuss with executives from the public and private sectors about
  how Open Source technologies, licenses, and models of development can provide economic
  and strategic advantages.
